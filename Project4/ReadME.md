Description
\b0 \'a0\
The purpose of this project is to develop the analysis and sample size sections for a grant application.\'a0 \
\'a0\
1) Group 1 will work on an analysis plan and sample size justification for Aim 1 only.\
2) Group 2 will work on an analysis plan and sample size justification for Aims 1 and 2.\
\'a0\
The write up for this project will be quite different from your previous projects.\'a0 I suspect you can draft an analysis section and an analysis plan in 1 to 1.5 double spaced pages for Group 1 and 2-pages for group 2.\'a0 You should include a Data Analysis section and a Sample size justification.\'a0 If you have two aims you can organize the report with two data analysis sections and one sample size section or organize the report by aims.\'a0 It is your choice.\

Power and Sample Size for this Calculation were done using G*Power Version 3.1 Software. A screenshot of the values used is available in the Docs folder. PROC POWER was also run in SAS 9.4 to confirm the sample size.  }
